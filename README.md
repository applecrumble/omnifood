Built following a [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/design-and-develop-a-killer-website-with-html5-and-css3/) by @jonasschmedtmann

## languages and libraries

- HTML5
- CSS3
- jQuery

## updates and upgrades
- replaced API key

I've downloaded this course a few years ago and by the time I've completed the final project and published it on GitHub Pages, the map provided by [gmaps.js](https://hpneo.dev/gmaps/) wasn't working anymore.

Following thesolution I found on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37403731/this-page-didnt-load-google-maps-correctly-see-the-javascript-console-for-tech), I got a new API key on [Google Developers](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key) and updated it.
